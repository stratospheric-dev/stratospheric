# Todo Application for Stratospheric

The purpose of this todo application is to serve as an example for the various use cases covered by the book.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Java 17 or higher](https://adoptium.net/)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (Optional as this project ships with the Gradle wrapper)

### Running the Application on Your Local Machine

* Make sure you have Docker up- and running (`docker info`) and Docker Compose installed (`docker compose version`)
* Start the required infrastructure with `docker compose up`
* Run `./gradlew bootRun` to start the application
* Access http://localhost:8080 in your browser

You can now log in with the following users: `duke`, `tom`, `bjoern`, `philip`. They all have the same password `stratospheric`.

### Application Profiles

- `dev` running the application locally for development. You don't need any AWS account or running AWS services for this. All infrastructure components are started from within the `compose.yaml` in the `application` directory.
- `aws` running the application inside AWS. This requires the whole infrastructure setup inside your AWS account.

### Running the Tests

Run `./gradlew test` from the command line.

### Deployment

You can deploy the application by using the standard Spring Boot deployment mechanism (see these three articles for more
information on Spring Boot deployment techniques and alternatives:

- [Deploying Spring Boot Applications](https://spring.io/blog/2014/03/07/deploying-spring-boot-applications),
- [Running your application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-running-your-application.html),
- [Installing Spring Boot applications](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/deployment-install.html)):
